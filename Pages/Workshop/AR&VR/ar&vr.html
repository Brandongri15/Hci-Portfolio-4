                    Unreal<br>
                    For our assignment, we were tasked to install unreal and follow a tutorial that tasked us all the basics we need to 
                    start creating our own project.The tutorial went through the process of an object creation all the way to animating it. 
                    Below you will see my progress through the tutorial.

                    A-Frame<br>
                    We were given a a premade folder with files inside for us to work on. We were given specific task that got more complex throughout.
                    The task prepped us for VR experiences and shows us how powerful simple web applications can be. Below are results from my task 1-4
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Task 1 | Hello World<br>
                    I increased the length of rectangle to give a springboard effect.

                    <br>
                    Task 2 | Shape<br>
                    I just wanted to create a maze of all the possible shapes inside of a-frame

                    <br>
                    Task 3 | Textures<br>
                    We learned how to apply texture to the rectangle to make it look like a plank of wood and learned how to apply texture to the plane, with a neat trick to avoid it looking dull and blurry.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Task 4 | Animations<br>
                    We learned how to rotate the various blocks individually form each other. This was done through property tag inside of a-frame neat framework.
                    <img src="/images/Rotate block.png" class="ar_img" width="98%">
                    <video width="98%" controls>

                      Animation Rotation

                      <br>
                    <br>
                    Task 5 | Interaction<br>
                    Through eventlisteners we can create cool effect that further enhance the interaction. We learned how we can gain inputs in our VR installations.
                    
                    <video width="98%" controls>
                        <source src="/images/51.mov .mov" type="video/mp4" width="98%">
                      Hovering effect on the block that is effected from entering and leaving results in two different states.

                        <source src="/images/55.mov .mov" type="video/mp4" width="98%">
                      When we hover over the right one we see that it rotates but once we leave it doesn't stop

                        here we can see the opposite of above.

                      Task 6 | Interaction Headset<br>
                      In this task we got learn how we can implement cursor into our headset and have our head be the mouse. We also got the chance to customise our cursor.
                      
                      <video width="98%" controls>
                          <source src="/images/53.mov .mov" type="video/mp4" width="98%">
                        This is the normal state that was presented to us that showcases the cursor in an ideal way.
                        </video>
                        <br>
                        <video width="98%" controls>
                          <source src="/images/56.mov .mov" type="video/mp4" width="98%">
                        Here we can see that I changed the cursor to a vey ugly and abstrusive cursor, on top of that i changed the fuse value to two and we can see that the sizing doubles drastically if i hover over it long enough
