                    <h2>EXERCISE 3:B | BLINK MULTIPLE LEDS </h2>
                    For this exercise we had to connect two Led to the breadboard (large white thing). From there we had make the green
                    & yellow led blink at the same time. The second task was too have the green and yellow alternating. Lastly to have 
                    the green blink twice as fast as yellow.

                        In this exercise we took data from the arduino into the program Processing and in the video we can see the reading in real time.

                          Arduino is a really cool hobby, there endless amount of diy possibilities and I am really glad I finally got a chance to tinker around with it.
                          The thought process and tangability of it all it was really made it for me. I really hope we continue to make project's in this nature.
                          The skills i've learned here will not only help me as a designer overall but my possibilities on diy projects.
