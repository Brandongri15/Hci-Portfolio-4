                    <h2>Lab Weeks | AR & VR</h2>
                     <p >For our HCI course we had two dedicated weeks to come-up with something in the realm of AR & VR. The idea was to create something ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù,
                        creative and with the new skills we just acquired. There was also an emphasis on cross branching with various technologies forms.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        <h2>Day 1</h2>
                        Day 1 was an interesting day for me, I was not initially set on doing something in the AR & VR. So, my day started off with researching what 
                        platforms we can use but before we could do that we needed to know if we doing AR or VR. We ultimately choose to with AR. With that setback 
                        done i moved forward investigating into Unity, Unreal & Three.js.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Unreal - was to Graphically dependent and with only having integrated Graphics, I knew I would be spending more time waiting for my program 
                        to Respond then actually tinkering. Three,js was an interesting platform it offered a wide range of possibilities, there was extensive examples 
                        of AR/VR and what you could do with it. There was a problem though and that was that we would be dependent on code and our abilities in it. This 
                        was a con for us so we looked into Unity. Unity provided a tool built in tools from Google with the AR Foundation. Another plus was that Unity 
                        was not as graphically intense as Unreal allowing for us to have smoother workflow. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once we understood our platform we looked further into what tools where available inside of Unity. We saw that there was a Vuforia engine that 
                        could detect images and various objects and had the features that was missing in AR Foundation. But we decided to go with what unity provided 
                        through their AR project template which was based on the XR-Plugin and AR Foundation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Day 2</h2>
                        <br>
                        Day 2 I started the day off with explaining our concept to the lectures. We saw that we had something to work with but needed to understand 
                        how we can push it to another level. So, I looked further into how human emotions work and how they can be read. Looking into various Arduino sensor‚Äôs.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I found out that we could use ECG sensors with Arduino and connect it to unity. However the cost of ECG sensors was pricey and would not arrive 
                        immediately. So I never explored that sector more.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For the rest of the day it was all about Tinkering in Unity creating objects, understanding the plane detection system and importing assets. 
                        We created a sphere that you could walk into to see a 3D world. This didn‚Äôt go so well
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Day 3</h2>
                        <br>
                        I wanted to explore more on what was possible with unity. What levels of interaction can we accomplish. Therefore i created two new separate
                        projects one to create virtual gesture control button‚Äôs and another to import API data into Unity.
                        <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Day 4</h2>
                        <br>
                        Day 4 was about collecting assets together to display the weather that came from the api. This weather was suppose to be real time so I needed 
                        assets that would fit our vision. So I looked for a bunch of low-poly weather effects and tried to connect them with the api. Which caused us to take a step back not forwards.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <h2>Day 5</h2>
                        Day 5 started with finishing the api calling and then to merge everything we have together. So, I had a sphere ball, virtual buttons & api data call through restapi‚Äôs this 
                        was all merged and nothing worked. We had overlapping scripts and not fully understanding Unity. Hindered me in isolating the issues. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Day 6</h2>
                        I put a pause on merging everything together as we as a group did not have an actual foundation. Once i received all assets form my teammate, I set about building them into 
                        Vuforia engine as AR Foundation was giving me seriously difficulty with the plane detection system. I also encountered problems with the focus with the Vuforia engine. I managed 
                        to fix this by sourcing through the Vuforia forums.

                        <h2>Day 7</h2>
                        We had our world set up. I then looked into how we can further deepen the interactive level on the world. I had a lot of issues where the placement of the world was 
                        incorrect or just very skew. So, i implemented a plugin called lean touch to allow me to rescale, rotate and position to my liking.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We also added a few very simple animations to the world rotating objects and move cars forward. 
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Day 8</h2>
                        I continued with the detailing of the world trying different forms of the terrains and adding in more elements to make the environment more lively. I started to do the API
                         calling again, but this time with a different approach. I used the help of a plugin. The ground that the town was resting on proved to be to time costly. So we decided to go with a plan green plane

                         <br>
                         <h2>Day 9</h2>
                         I started the day with fixing the Image detection and scaling all objects to fit onto mobile screen. Using a plugin to control the weather simulation to the api that was being called. I then took
                        the code from my teammate who did the gaze interaction. Took a lot rescaling but I managed to finish the project from my side and film before the day of the expo.

                         <h2>Day 10</h2>
                         Day 10 was the Expo, me and my group made presented our parts of the project. I was chair leader for one of the pre-expo groups and had to just make sure everything ran 
                         smoothly and that all parties attended. After that I had to report which of the group projects would move forward to the expo and hand over the attendance report to Chris. 
                         Later that day we had the final expo which had a lot of cool very interesting projects. A lot of them in a higher fidelity than I would have expected. The musical plants was 
                         the outstanding project for me in the whole expo.

                         <h2>Final Project</h2>
                        <br>
                        Our Final project trip town is an imaginary town with various interactive elements. We would have hoped to do more and expand the world more. Because the way it stands at the moment 
                        its very much a novelty. I play with it once or twice but then I am done with it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our world has multiple 3D assets that have been put together to build a lifelike town. We also have various lighting elements involved. For example the fire reflects its lights point 
                        of surrounding areas, to create the illusion of heat. The weather is controlled by a weather pack that has very environments inside of it. The api is called through an external plug-in
                         called real-time weather. The clouds are downloaded from the Unity asset store but they are connected to the 
                        weather. The cars are stationary but we did try and animate a two cars, the animations are not very smooth however more work would need to be put into these. We also added a gaze 
                        interaction that cause information to popup on certain building. In our town the popup are located at the gas station‚Äôs indicating you the fuel prices. The gaze interaction is 3 part 
                        setup, one script is used for the camera which notifies the system that the camera is looking at you and once it reaches your hit box you need to show yourself. The second part is the 
                        actual transformation of the board coming up from the building.  The 3rd script is the script that tells the board to rotate in the direction the camera is facing. The last element of 
                        our trip town is the ability to freely move the town in the xyz axis. On top of that you can scale and rotate respectively.

                       <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        Overall our group managed to come up with something we are happy with. We got off to a rocky start not wanting to do AR&VR caused for us to not know where to begin. We took long to find 
                        inspiration for what to do and we kept changing ideas. Yet despite the fact of not being able to agree on a final concept we kept tinkering understand our capabilities more and more. 
                        Which brought us to where we are. The contraptions on both parties was amble, we did our own things but we did not stop finding out new methods new ways of interacting. We did not just 
                        talk but actually built which was what allowed us to explore so many areas in the first place. I am also happy with how I contributed to the group. I feel like I did not stand still, i was 
                        trying to solve problem and finds new technologies that we could integrate into our AR world. I learned lots of new skills, I feel very confident in using Unity for basic level builds. It 
                        is also a platform I would like to further experiment with. Considering I was daunted by the fact that C# is the scripting language I have grown quite to like it. Not that I understand it 
                        but I get a rough idea of what is happening and written in the scripts. I do believe there are some things I can improve on for the future which is my attitude to projects that do not speak 
                        my interest. I should have seen the project as a challenge from the get go and not 4 days deep. I would have liked to use more of the skills learned in the other Lecture weeks and seen how 
                        we could have integrated Arduino into our build. Overall I found the Lab weeks to be very intense. It was the perfect way for us to take all our learning and stuff them into one big melting pot. 
                        A clearer direction would have been helpful but that is not the life of a designer is it.
