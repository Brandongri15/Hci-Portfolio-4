                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                 <p >Humans in nature are exploratory, so when we throw something out of the ordinary  to them they are bound to investigate. This is 
                     what we call Playful interaction, so you can imagine that if done correctly we can completely alter the behaviour. Often times 
                     these types of interaction are created to invoke positive changes, to encourage you to do a boring task.

                    <h2>Assignment 1 - New Concept</h2>
                    <b>Floor-Dash</b><br>
                    My envisioned play space would be in on of the floors in the oval section. The floor space would be a screen with various sensors on
                     it that displayed 2d objects that need to be avoided by the players walking by. The idea of the space is to activate the brains and 
                     to rid the student of their normal routine. A bit of a shake/wake up is what you could call it. The reason for choosing the oval is 
                     due to the circular shape that resulting in a continuous loop.

                    While players cannot directly interact with each other. Does not mean they do not have  the ability to race each other. The system 
                    can detect if a user has hit an object and through that a sound vibration is sent to that area to notify the user. The player himself 
                    does not interact with the system as it operated autonomously. The only input method that comes into the system is when the hit detector 
                    has detected that the passing player has hit an object. Which results in an output form the system to vibrate that block to notify the 
                    user that his input has been registered.

                        <b>Research</b><br>
                        The makers of this project are MBA students from UKM University. They initially saw that people are not cleaning their feet when 
                        entering the building and wanted to investigate this further. Through their conducted research they learned that 0% of people did 
                        wipe their feet and they wanted to create to change that habit. With no one wiping their feet on the entrance mat it caused a lot 
                        of unnecessary dirt going into the building. Further causing more avoidable work for the cleaner‚Äôs. So they decided to create a 
                        more mat that would unconsciously force them to wipe their feet. The thought concept was to bring the inner child out of everyone 
                        by making it a fun activity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The finished project was quite simple and very cost effective. They bought children shoes that had squeaky soles which was then 
                        wrapped with cardboard and finally on top they placed a mat to give it the appearance of a welcome mat. The end results was a very 
                        successful one, in the demonstration you can see all age groups returning to step/jump on the mat releasing some of their child play.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The input technology is quite simple the force exerted onto the mat pushes the cardboard to press against the soles thus executing a 
                        return so an output of a squeaky toy. The type of play that can be seen is a single-user experience yet they share their bodies. Meaning 
                        they are using their bodies to act independent to one another but they are executing they same action.

                        <b>Reflection</b><br>
                        I think the topic in a whole misses the bigger aspect of it all, a lot of the projects or experiments are a short term experiment. 
                        It‚Äôs amazing to see how we can impact and change human behaviour with a simple trick or experience, yet for me it is too much of a novelty.
                         When we discover something new or unordinary we have our natural inclination to explore it. That why we see user being bewildered and 
                         investigating these props. Yet we never truly see a permanent installation of these and my question is why. Is it because we will become 
                         used to it and the novelty disappears and we return to our behaviours of before? On the other hand the future of playful interaction may 
                         not as bleak. I believe that we will see more of these types of installation. With an objective  of trying to grab our attention away of the 
                         digital world. Some being more invasive than others. Regardless of that aspect it is still a very fascinating topic, trying to understand 
                         how we can make other tick and change through simple manipulation.
