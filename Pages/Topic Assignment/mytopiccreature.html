                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                 <p >Homeostasis model is quite the interesting one at that, and surprisingly it can also be compared to ‚Äúmachines‚Äù as we learned in 
                     our HCI Lecture. This model states that an equilibrium can be found between needs and desires. As part of the lecture we need to 
                     apply this model to an electronic device. In the following i will be applying this model to a printer. A printer in itself is not 
                     that interesting, but it has a few needs to be able to compute.

                    <h2>Assignment 1 - Thought Experiment | Printer</h2>
                    <b>1. Ink Cartridges</b><br>
                    The Printer requires Ink to be able to function. Without ink he has no way of actually printing anything that we can see. This need 
                    can be compared to the human spine, as we humans require our spine to be able to send signal to our muscles for them to react to what 
                    we want to tell them. It like the messenger. For the printer the ink cartridges carry the same responsibility.

                    <b>2.Paper Tray</b><br>
                    A printer needs to have a full paper tray to be able to print, this can be compared to food for Humans. The paper is very simply put its 
                    resource panel without it cannot function. We humans cannot function without nutrients, and that is what paper is for a printer.  Without 
                    the printers nutrients it cannot continue its process therefore being halted.

                    <b>3.Paper Feeder</b><br>
                    The Paper feeder is the feet to the human without it we cannot move forward or adjust ourselves. The paper feeder is what moves and aligns 
                    the paper from the tray to the ink cartridges, by having this feeder the printer can ensure that the image is printed on the piece of paper 
                    as the User has seen on screen.

                        <b>Research</b><br>
                        CNH industrial recently launched their driverless tractor. The tractor is able to work 24/7 it also is able to hook up onto almost all
                         existing agriculture equipment and obviously the fancy schmanzy object detection system. The reason i find this project interesting is 
                         because it a new approach, its not an approach that does not serve some sort of purpose. It makes sense to me why you would have something 
                         like this. Especially with seasonal changes we as humans cannot work 24/7 and we do not know always have enough time to prep our crops and
                          lay everything down. By having something like this you are able to improve your crop growth in a more natural way without including chemical 
                          compounds to enhance the crops.

                        <b>Reflection</b><br>
                        All in all I feel that the lecture brought a lot of new insight‚Äôs for me, even though i struggle to see how every machine has needs like a human. 
                         Yet it also scares me to know how far we can develop something to fit our exact expectations of realism.  We can easily deep fake people and unleash 
                         havoc as a result, spread fake news. Especially high profile people are very susceptible to this. The technology is impressive and how much of it 
                         derives to our behaviours and perception was new to me.
