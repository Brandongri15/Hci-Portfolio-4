                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                 <p >AR & VR is a technology of the future and it enables us to be immersed into a world unlike our own. 
                    There is a lot room and ideas for various industries, the sad truth is that the technology is not 
                    there or too expensive for an industrial use. With time we will be seeing new leaps and innovations 
                    coming out that we only can imagine now.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would like to add on the imagination of ideas with three of my very own concepts.

                    <h2>Assignment 1 - Concept Creation</h2>
                    <b>Concept one</b><br>
                     is for Injured sports player, specifically for this example an injured soccer player. 
                                        Often Player sit months in rehabilitation needing to train on their own or going through therapy. 
                                        In this concept Players will be immersed into the world of the football field while nursing their 
                                        mental and physical health back. User would be put on a larger treadmill where they can freely 
                                        run and to have the experience of the ball you would have a ball attached to one end that can 
                                        freely rotate with the player and extends the ball out to them when they in the VR the ball 
                                        approaches them. The spring inside the arm could also adjust the strength to protect the Player 
                                        from further injuries.

                <p>
                    <b>Concept two</b><br> would be an AR application that would represent  the world without Humans. So you can go to various Area 
                    and see an interpretation of various scientist of how the world would grow without Humans. Through this process we can 
                    see how much we have taken from the natural ecosystem. By showing this we can incentivise people to understand that we 
                    can live here but we should also respect what we have been given. The human ego is great for us to further evolve.

                <p>
                    <b>The Third Concept</b><br>
                     and final is a simulation of physics on real world objects. So say you looking at a bridge and you are 
                    wondering how did they manage to keep that thing in the air or how does that support so much traffic. With this AR application
                     you can see all the forces that are acting upon the bridge and thus explaining how they counteract the forces and finally 
                     land on the results that you see before your own Eyes. So they can see the fluid dynamics the airflow stress tension all 
                     in their own screen. Seeing what the eye cannot see.

                <h2>Assignment 2 - Research</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>I-Mechanic</b><br>
                    I found this very interesting App called I-Mechanic, which is a failed Indiegogo Startup that basically tried to create a 
                    tool to help user‚Äôs do automotive maintenance on their own car. The application detects the components in the car and informs
                     the user what they mean and offers to play the user a tutorial to do the maintenance themselves. I feel like it can be pushed
                    further though. A 3D rending on more complex parts or areas the mechanic cannot see with the eye by giving a 3D image where the 
                    user can scale and rotate to understand where the bolts and connectors are located. This is only scratching the surface of this concept. 
                    It could be pushed so much further. I think this ultimately the reason it failed. The use case was just too small and the target market 
                    was the wrong one. Having you phone hover over the bonnet is no different to watching a youtube tutorial.  It lacked the sense in solving a problem. 
                    Because now you see everything but you need to put your phone down again to work on the car, thus causing you to put it somewhere stationary, to watch the video.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    AR & VR offer a  depth of immersion that cannot be easily replicated. The problem for me is that it is not accessible for everyone. After a pair of oculus 
                    quest 2 and all the various accessories you down about 500‚Ç¨ that is if you have a PC powerful to power it. The sad truth is that the immersion is lost when
                     using google cardboard it regained a bit with the plastic housing and a pair of headphones . There are also major struggles when it comes to the interfaces, 
                     I feel the experience of interfaces in VR often ruins the immersion effect. The future of AR is bright there are a lot of cool concept that can evolve for it. 
                     It just feels like we haven't develop the technology on an industrial level to really get the full effect of VR/AR.
