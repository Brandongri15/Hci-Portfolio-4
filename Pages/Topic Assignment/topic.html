                                            not only with technology <br>but with the ethical implications that are present. In our<br> HCI lecture we looked
                                            further into this topic and<br> here you can find my views on the Lecture.

                                         to digital<br> wearables. So, it comes to no surprise that this was<br> a hot topic in our HCI Lecture.</p>

                                           This is a quote that comes from the <br>movie A.I Artificial Intelligence.
                                        I believe this fits well<br> with our discussion in the HCI Lecture and in the<br> following 
                                        I will be reflection upon the fore-mentioned.

                                          As someone once said "You were<br> <em>WILD</em> once. Don't let them tame you.", and<br> in our HCI lecture this 
                                          message came across to<br> us. In the following I want to reflect on that.
