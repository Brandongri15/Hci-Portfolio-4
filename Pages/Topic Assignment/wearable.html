                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                 <p >As we learned early on with HCI course we know that technology is engulfing us and we spend more time on our devices 
                     than we do with each other.  So with the Assignment today, we were given two cases. I chose to go with the Brainwave case. 
                     We were set out to create a social interaction with brainwaves. The end goal is to be able to detect each other emotions.

                    <h2>Assignment 1 - Concept Creation</h2>
                    <b>FeelPad</b><br>
                    My concept involves user have 6 pads located in various areas of the body. One behind the ear to read the various wave that 
                    are going through the neural-pathways. These are then emitted/boosted by that very same pad. The user then has 5 additional 
                    ones on the top of each finger. Each finger represents a different wavelength. 4 of the pads are Frequency catches that catch 
                    the emitted/boosted frequencies and vibrate according to the emotion detected. The 5th Pad is located on the thumb as a on/off 
                    switch. These caught signal‚Äôs communicate through haptics, to showcase the emotions. Due to the nature the user can only distinguish 
                    between 6 emotions; Happiness - fear - anger - sadness -disgust -surprise.

                <br>
                <b>Research - Waveform</b><br>
                So I found this cool wearable that intends on creating an even more immersive experience in VR.  This wearable ‚ÄúWaveform‚Äù was created by a 
                person named Kyle Hamm & Yankodesigns who recently graduated Western Washington University. The wearable he created creates haptic feedback 
                that correlates to the audio that is playing. Creating further immersion, i find it impressive how he managed to create something so sleek 
                and simple, yet i know that this would upgrade my gaming experience significantly. Being immersed to a point where more than just two senses 
                being touched is really cool. Racing steering Wheels have been doing this for years they use force feedback to translate information to the user. 
                Following that but for the whole body will bring us to a point where we will believe we in another world. What also impressive about this is that 
                most of the projection he did on his own (Kyle).

                <b>Reflection</b><br>
                With our lives being more digitised everyday, I can‚Äôt see how we won‚Äôt be wearing google glasses. The problem I have with wearables at the moment is 
                that they are too invasive.  A lot of them just feel so disconnected from me. They don‚Äôt feel like support me or are an extension from my phone which 
                is the main object of my digital life. However there is no doubt that wearables can benefit us greatly. As the above mentioned example will enhance our
                 immersion when playing VR or even watching movies. I am excited to see what the future brings for us.
