                <h2>Guest Lecture Assignment</h2>
                 <p >In our guest lecture we got to have an insight into the various projects NEXT EMPIRE has been working on. They showed us
                    quite a few interesting project from the backstage. we got to understand the thought process, the goal, the idea & how the end
                    product came to fruition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Out of all of the projects the one that stood out from a technological point of view I found the Coca-Cola Zoetrope to be the most 
                    impressive. The minute details that went into it. Details we might never see or appreciate is flabbergasting, quite honestly impressed 
                    with how they synchronise all the various object‚Äôs and still feel real. I was fortunate enough to see it in person and it is far more 
                    impressive than the presentation gives it justice. The project was a collaboration with the Coca-Cola & Efteling team. Coca-Cola is a 
                    sponsor for Efteling and wanted a standalone installation for them to advertise their beverage. The Zoetrop is quite an complex piece of Art.

                </p>
                <p>A Zoetrop is a manifestation of individual framed animations. TThis whole contraptions becomes more impressive when you learn that the installation is made
                     out 300 individual 3D printed figures, that have all been designed from scratch. The challenge of building it in 
                    direct sunlight was solved through ‚Äúsee through‚Äù glass. the glass basically allows for light to pass through the one side but not the owner. 
                    Thus allowing for light to be trapped on the outside of the enclosure. This enabled for the strobe light to have the desired affects to enable 
                    for the perceived effect of an animation. While also increasing the fidelity of the whole installation. A unique little twist is that the lever 
                    too actuate the Zoetrop is a coke bottle connected to a bottle opener that you lift, as if you were opening it.

                    Next Empire also put a lot of effort in representing the two parties involved in the project. Expressing the iconic coca cola red had to be done through
                     a complex sanding process and certain type of wax coat too fully express it.

                    <br>
                    Another reason why I quite like this project is because it reminds me of our playful Interaction lecture. It reminds you that human behaviour and perception 
                    can be easily manipulated and that manipulation can be something good, if done right.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I found this very interesting App called I-Mechanic, which is a failed Indiegogo Startup that basically tried to create a 
                    tool to help user‚Äôs do automotive maintenance on their own car. The application detects the components in the car and informs
                     the user what they mean and offers to play the user a tutorial to do the maintenance themselves. I feel like it can be pushed
                    further though. A 3D rending on more complex parts or areas the mechanic cannot see with the eye by giving a 3D image where the 
                    user can scale and rotate to understand where the bolts and connectors are located. This is only scratching the surface of this concept. 
                    It could be pushed so much further. I think this ultimately the reason it failed. The use case was just too small and the target market 
                    was the wrong one. Having you phone hover over the bonnet is no different to watching a youtube tutorial.  It lacked the sense in solving a problem. 
                    Because now you see everything but you need to put your phone down again to work on the car, thus causing you to put it somewhere stationary, to watch the video.
